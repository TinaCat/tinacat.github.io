                    <h4>The story of a young chicken that has to make a life-changing choice.</h4>
                    <p>
                        A young chicken is struggling with his identity. When he was a baby a farmer adopted him after his parents abandoned him, or so he thought. He has not lived with any of his species and is trying to find who he is as a chicken. One day he is looking for any evidence of who his parents were and where he came from; what he found was horrifying. In a box under a bed and covered in dust were the receipts of a sale. It was in the amount of $10.50 for the sale of two chickens to Nugget Co., the largest company that supported the deformation of the chicken’s natural form. With this huge conflict of his reality of the farmer no longer being his savior he is dumbfounded as to what to do. How will he find peace? Will he take revenge or walk away?

                            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/yolksart1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>It was a beautiful day on a vast farm; the animals continuing about their day as if any other. Amid them stood a lone chicken pecking at some freshly spread seed. As the only chicken on the farm, he was normally resigned to a lonely day of clucking and feeding. This day, however, would not follow the same tedious algorithm as its predecessors.</p>

                            <p>A disruption! Thoughts of existential proportions flood the previously numb mind of the chicken. Without any knowledge of his past, the inevitable quandary was presented; the consideration of one’s existence. As if jolted by the nearby electric fence, the chicken’s heart jumped and thumped. He suddenly raised his head and began walking toward the barn.</p>

                            <p>There was not much to be seen inside the barn, various livestock, supplies, and a peculiar set of steps upward. The chicken knew of these stairs but had never dared venture up them. But again, this day was not like the rest. A sense of adventure meant caution would be tossed aside and, alas, up the stairs he would go.</p>

                            <p>The attic was dark and damp, the cobwebs spread across the rafters seemingly glowed in comparison to their background. Clutter blocked the way in all but one direction; funneling the chicken into a small room. He searched the room, aimlessly hoping to find something of significance.</p>

                            <p>On the nearby desk was a leather bound book, a bookmark placed about midway through it. The chicken also noticed a pamphlet laid flat on the floor with “Nugget Corp.” brightly printed on its front. There was also a peculiar box in the corner that looked as if it had been recently opened. </p>

                            <p>Despite it being fittingly ragged, the box’s presence seems rather irregular. As if recently opened, there is a distinct lack of dirt on its top. The chicken lifts the lid and peers inside; finding a large, unorganized pile of documents. Upon further examination he finds a receipt for sale of two chickens to Nugget Corp., a massive corporation specialized in the “reformation” of various livestock. Attached to it is a picture of a rooster and a hen standing aside the farmer; in his hands, a baby chick squeaks its first breaths.</p>

                            <p>Suddenly, a moment of intuition! The chicken’s legs weaken with the realization; these chickens were his parents. The farmer, once considered to be his savior, was now the antithesis of one. At that very moment, the chicken hears footsteps coming up the attic stairs; if he is quick enough the chicken can continue searching the attic’s contents before he is discovered.</p>

                            <p>The chicken approaches the desk on which the book is placed. The thick layer of dust on its cover indicates the lack of recent use; a single swipe reveals the word “Journal” across the center. Tucked into the corner of the title page is a ragged photo of a young man standing aside a stunningly beautiful young woman. The chicken flips to the bookmarked page and begins reading. The page, stained with age, reads:</p>

                            <p>“After going over the books it looks like I’ll need to do something to pay the taxes due next week…I hope it doesn’t come to selling the livestock. But I’ll do whatever it takes…I made a promise that I must keep…for her…”</p>

                            <p>The journal, seemingly that of the farmer, provided the chicken some insight into the struggles of its author’s life. Still, something compelled him to continue searching the room in which he stood. He then closed the book and placed it back in its original position; turning his eye to the remaining objects in the room.</p>

                            <p>The chicken picks up the pamphlet on the floor; the bright colors and recent publish date show that it was recently acquired and placed here. The chicken flips it open and reads: </p>

                            <p>“Nugget Corp! The world leader in nuggets of all kind! If you have livestock to offload call the number below and speak with one of our representatives today!”</p>

                            <p>The chicken’s stomach sinks as the thought of becoming a nugget slides through his mind; a cruel and horrid fate. He then places the pamphlet back on the floor and continues searching the room.</p>

                            <p>The farmer emerges from the stairs. Nervously fiddling with his overalls, he glances over at the chicken. The chicken’s gaze turns from the receipt to the farmer and, as if the witness of something atrocious, the farmer looks on with horror; fully aware of that which the chicken has discovered.</p>

                            <p>In a flash of fury, the chicken lunges toward the farmer; forcing him to the ground. His hands firmly around the farmer’s throat, the chicken begins squeezing tighter by the second. He screams: “How could you do this!? I should kill you where you lie!” The farmer, gasping for air, replies: “I…I had to. It’s a decision I’ve regretted ever since!”</p>

                            <p>The chicken then begins the beating; each swing harder than the last. Suddenly, to the farmer’s relief, he loosens his grip; contemplating the repercussions of his possible vengeance. An internal struggle: forgiveness and morality or rage and revenge?</p>

                            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/yolksart5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The chicken cannot contain his rage. With eyes of fire and revenge his main goal; he tightens his grip around the farmer’s throat. The helpless man struggles but can’t fight off the assault. After a few long moments the farmer goes limp, finalizing the vengeance that was so desired. The chicken, exhausted yet energetic, then stands up, grabs the picture of his parents, and begins walking down the attic stairs.</p>

                            <p>With the dirty deed done, the chicken was now solely focused on finding his parents; failure to do so, in his mind, was simply not an option. He packed up some necessities and, with a foolhardy determination, set out to save his parents. The journey would take him far from the farm he once called “home.” There were, however, no obvious alternatives; they had to be saved.</p>

                            <p>So he set out in search of his parents. The farm, a secluded plot of land, had only one connecting road. It was a crude, dusty path that rarely had much traffic. The chicken, with one thumb out and a determined look on his face, began walking south down the road. Unfortunately no rides would come for him; wasting crucial time. It would be a long and tiring walk but the chicken was now on course for Nugget Corp. and, he hoped, his parents. Despite his resolve, the chicken wasn’t quite sure what, if anything, he’d do once he arrived.</p>

                            <p>After several hours of walking, the chicken now stood on a street corner in a bustling city. Directly in front of him was a massive skyscraper with a bright neon sign at its pinnacle; the sign read “Nugget Corp.” The long journey had expended a great deal of time and energy but he had finally reached his destination. The hardest part, however, was still to come.</p>

                            <p>He approached the building, taking note of the heavy security placed at its main entrance. Walking in the front door was obviously not a viable option, not that he had considered it to be so. A glance to the alleyway that hugged the buildings side revealed an unmanned fire escape; this would be his entrance.</p>

                            <p>Flight after flight, the chicken raced up the stairs; eventually reaching the rooftop. At the summit was a series of air conditioning vents. With a smirk on his face, the chicken revels in the golden opportunity presented to him. He removes the grate and hops in; sliding down the smooth metal interior until reaching a stable position.</p>

                            <p>Grunting throughout, he maneuvers his way through the labyrinth that is the ventilation shaft; eventually finding a grate through which he can look. As he peers into the room below he sees a countless number of cages, all of which are filled with various chickens. He pulls out the picture of his parents and gazes deeply into it. A sudden wave of anxiety hits him; something doesn’t feel right.</p>

                            <p>Regardless, he continues on; lowering himself into the room. Once inside, the chicken begins examining the cages one by one; hoping to find his parents amongst the prisoners. One mismatch after another, the chicken’s search grows more desperate. An hour passes and, hundreds of cages later, he stumbles onto an empty cage. As he approaches it a small, stained piece of paper floats to the ground. With a trembling hand, the chicken picks it up and begins reading:</p>

                            <p>“The days grow shorter, each one fading faster than the last. They took away my journal this morning, I managed to hide this last scrap of paper…I fear these may be my last words. Despite the farmer’s betrayal, he is forgiven; a lost love will drive the most pure of men to near lunacy. I just wish I could see my son again, I’m sure he’ll grow into a rooster of honorable morality. But alas, the clocks spin faster and my time grows shorter. I am, however, comforted to spend my waning moments with my husband; talking of the son we have never known, but will always love.”</p>

                            <p>The chicken collapses to the ground and begins sobbing; the letter, presumably his mother’s last testament, still firmly in his grasp. His parents were gone; a crippling realization that paralyzes the entirety of his body. Along with this, however, was the content of the letter; an exemplary reminder of unconditional love. The chicken, blinded by rage, had let his life fade into malice. Because of the choices he had made, the lives of his parents, along with that of the farmer, could not be saved. The burden of this would forever haunt him; a fate of unnerving proportions.</p>

                            <p>With his business here complete, the chicken decides to leave; his failure still hanging heavily over his head. But where was he to go? His parents were dead. The home he once had in the farm was now no more than an empty reminder of his mistakes and their resulting consequences; he wouldn’t dare explore the depths to which he had fallen. But alas, he continued on. Without any specific destination, he walks along hoping that someday he can rectify the mistakes he’s made and, ultimately, find a true sense of belonging.</p>

                            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <p>The chicken, near to inflicting the finishing blow, thinks back to the journal he found; envisioning the image of the young farmer and his beautiful wife. He feels a pain in his chest, a sudden influx of emotion, a level of empathy never previously experienced. This abrupt understanding halts him in his tracks. His arm slowly dropping, he looks into the old man’s eyes. As if gazing into a tortured soul, the chicken falls back in fear; realizing the depths to which he had almost fallen. A quick glance up reveals the beaten, yet still breathing, farmer. The chicken, shaking violently, then stands up, grabs the picture of his parents, and begins walking down the attic stairs.</p>

                            <p>With the confrontation behind him, the chicken could now focus solely on finding his parents; failure to do so, in his mind, was simply not an option. He packed up some necessities and, with a foolhardy determination, set out to save his parents. The journey would take him far from the farm he once called “home.” There were, however, no obvious alternatives; they had to be saved.</p>

                            <p>So he set out in search of his parents. The farm, a secluded plot of land, had only one connecting road. It was a crude, dusty path that rarely had much traffic. The chicken, with one thumb out and a determined look on his face, began walking south down the road. As if a karmic gift, a pickup truck filled with, ironically enough, caged chickens approached; slowing to a halt in from of the chicken.</p>

                            <p>The refreshingly jovial driver, heading south toward the city, extended an invitation; one of unbelievable timing. The usually long trip would be expedited, enabling the chicken to reach Nugget Corp. and, he hoped, his parents much sooner. Despite his resolve, the chicken wasn’t quite sure what, if anything, he’d do once he arrived. Regardless, he hopped in the truck bed and set in motion the first leg of his journey.</p>

                            <p>After a seemingly short ride, the chicken now stood on a street corner in a bustling city. Directly in front of him was a massive skyscraper with a bright neon sign at its pinnacle; the sign read “Nugget Corp.” The long journey had expended a great deal of energy but he had finally reached his destination. The hardest part, however, was still to come.</p>

                            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/yolksart11.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>He approached the building, taking note of the heavy security placed at its main entrance. Walking in the front door was obviously not a viable option, not that he had considered it to be so. A glance to the alleyway that hugged the buildings side revealed an unmanned fire escape; this would be his entrance.</p>

                            <p>Flight after flight, the chicken raced up the stairs; eventually reaching the rooftop. At the summit was a series of air conditioning vents. With a smirk on his face, the chicken revels in the golden opportunity presented to him. He removes the grate and hops in; sliding down the smooth metal interior until reaching a stable position.</p>

                            <p>Grunting throughout, he maneuvers his way through the labyrinth that is the ventilation shaft; eventually finding a grate through which he can look. As he peers into the room below he sees a countless number of cages, all of which are filled with various chickens. He pulls out the picture of his parents and gazes deeply into it. A sudden wave of excitement hits him; somehow he could feel his parents’ presence below.</p>

                            <p>Eager to find them, he presses on; lowering himself into the room. Once inside, the chicken begins examining the cages one by one; hoping to find his parents amongst the prisoners. One mismatch after another, the chicken’s search grows more desperate. Suddenly, a female voice calls out “Son?” The chicken jerks his head toward the voice and begins running faster and harder than ever before. He turns a corner and, alas, finds a cage holding a hen and a rooster. A quick glance at the picture for comparison confirms his hope; these were his parents!</p>

                            <p>The chicken picks up a nearby pipe and bashes it against the cage’s lock; shattering its rusty body. The cage flies open and the captives hop out. Looking up at their long lost son, the hen and rooster smile at the sight. Unfortunately, this was a time for action, not emotion; all would be for naught it they couldn’t escape the facility. The three run back to the air vent shaft from which the chicken gained access. A quick tug of the rope indicates it to still be firmly in place.</p>

                            <p>With his parents safety the prime target, the chicken gestures that they climb up to a relative haven. The two nod their heads and begin climbing the rope. After a few tense moments, the chicken watches his parents reach the top and begin their ascent to the roof. He then climbs into the shaft and begins following the vent upward. Upon reaching the top he reunites with his parents. The chicken, short of options, decides to return to the farm; hoping to find a haven in which his parents could remain. A quick descent down the fire escape meant the party could escape into the darkness; beginning their trek back to the farm they once called home.</p>

                            <p>After several hours of running, the chicken and his parents finally make it to the farmland; they then hastily retreat to the barn. The farmer, eyes welled with tears and bruised from the previous encounter, looks on as the three enter. The image of his caged parents clouds the chicken’s mind. A rush of blood to his head brings along with it an immeasurable amount of rage. In a haze, the chicken begins running toward the farmer; his death the main priority.</p>

                            <p>In a calm yet assertive tone, his mother cries out in disapproval. Like a well-trained soldier, the chicken halts his approach and turns back to the hen. Her gaze conveying exactly that which she is trying to imply; the farmer’s death will solve nothing. The farmer, recognizing this undeserved mercy, falls to his knees and begins sobbing wildly. With the acknowledgement of his mistake, the farmer offers the three permanent shelter.</p>

                            <p>Despite the expected resent, the hen and rooster nod, agreeing to stay. The chicken, however, looks to the ground and shakes his head; he knew this was not his destiny. He felt that without a full understanding of his purpose, he could never attain true happiness. The chicken slowly walks to his parents and, to their dismay, says his farewells. A flood of emotion bursts forth as they exchange their goodbyes. After one last glance at the farmer, the chicken turns and begins walking.</p>

                            <p>His parents safe and protected under the farmers lodging, the chicken could now focus on his quest for self-understanding. A daunting, seemingly impossible task would see this little chicken venture far beyond the presumed range of possibilities. The first step of this endeavor led him away from that which he fought so hard to save. This exodus, however, would provide him the necessary closure required to point his attention inward; staring into his own existence rather than that of his environment. So, without any specific destination, he walked along hoping that someday he can discover his purpose and, ultimately, find a true sense of belonging.</p>
